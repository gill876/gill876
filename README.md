I joined GitHub **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago and since then I have pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** PRs, received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.  

Currently on a **{{ COMMIT_STREAK }}** day commit streak.
